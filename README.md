## Introduction

This assignment requires students to create an enhanced scanner for the lox programming language by following Chapter 4 of the "Crafting Interpreters" textbook. You are to work in the lox team you have already set up for this lab. In addition to getting a working scanner as it is implemented in the book, you are responsible for adding a small extension for the scanner and provide a complete documentation for the  scanner in the README of the `lox_interpreter` repository. Furthermore, each team is invited to engage in a code walkthrough and a demonstration with a TL and/or instructor during the next week's lab.

You are responsible for storing alll implementation for this lab in your team's `lox_interpreter` repository. 

## Learning

To enhance your understanding of the concepts and code of this laboratory assignment, you should carefully read [Chapter 4 in Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html).

## Requirements

1. Complete working version of the scanner from the textbook.
2. Small enhancement to the scanner.
3. Complete documentation.
4. Participation in the walkthrough and demo.

### Working Scanner

Follow [Chapter 4 in Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html) textbook to arrive at a working scanner. Note, you may need to make some adjustments to the code from the book to get it to the working state.

### Enhancements

Add one small enhancement to make the scanner better. Most enhancements might be cosmetic or add to the usability of the scanner (for example, better error reporting).

### Documentation

### Walkthrough and Demo

## Assignment Assessment

GitHub Actions is not used in this assignment. The grade that a student receives on this assignment will have the following components.

- **Mastery of Verbal Explanation [up to 15%]:** Students will receive a portion of their grade when their explanations presented during the walkthrough reveal a thorough understanding of the code. 

- **Mastery of Technical Writing [up to 15%]:** Students will also receive a portion of their grade when the documentation reveals a proficiency of both writing skills and technical knowledge. 

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills [up to 45%]:** Students will receive a portion of their assignment grade when their lab solution reveals that they have mastered all of the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of this assignment. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects of the project including, but not limited to, the completeness and correctness of the scanner, the required extension, and contributions of each student to the project on GitHub.

All grades for this project will be reported through a student's gradebook GitHub repository.

## Assistance

If you are having trouble completing any part of this project, then please talk with the course instructor or technical leaders during the laboratory session. Alternatively, you may ask questions in the Discord channel for this course. Finally, you can schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours.
